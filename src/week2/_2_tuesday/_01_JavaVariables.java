             /* TODO Java Variables
        Variables are containers for storing data values.

           In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

        String ---- stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
        int ---- stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
        float ----- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
        char -----stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
        boolean ---- stores values with two states: true or false
